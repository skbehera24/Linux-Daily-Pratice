Package Management in Linux
==============================
1)It is used to install software in Linux.
2)We have several package management in Linux.




eg:


amazon  Linux used "yum"  package management


ubuntu  Linux used "apt"  package management

centos  Linux used "dfg"  package management

 centos  Linux used "yum"  package management (latesly used yum)

red hat   Linux used "yum"  package management


yum: yellow dog update & modified 
apt: advanced package tool
dfg:dangified  yum package






Install java/python / on amazon Linux
-----------------------------------------

*      sudo yum install java/pyrhon


Install python/java/maven on ubuntu
-------------------------------------

*     sudo apt install python



sumit@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install python
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Package python is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  2to3 python2-minimal python2 dh-python python-is-python3



Check the packages which we install
-------------------------------------

whereis java
where python
where is maven




sumit@ubuntu:~$ whereis java
java: /usr/share/java
sumit@ubuntu:~$



what is sudoers file ?
------------------------




1. this is file in Linux like other file.
2.it helps to manage what a user and what a user group can do on the Linux.
3.we can see that file below command


command:   sudo cat /etc/sudoers 




sumit@ubuntu:~$
sumit@ubuntu:~$  sudo cat /etc/sudoers
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
Defaults        use_pty

# This preserves proxy settings from user environments of root
# equivalent users (group sudo)
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy all_proxy no_proxy"

# This allows running arbitrary commands, but so does ALL, and it means
# different sudoers have their choice of editor respected.
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "EDITOR"

# Completely harmless preservation of a user preference.
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "GREP_COLOR"

# While you shouldn't normally run git as root, you need to with etckeeper
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "GIT_AUTHOR_* GIT_COMMITTER_*"

# Per-user preferences; root won't have sensible values for them.
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "EMAIL DEBEMAIL DEBFULLNAME"

# "sudo scp" or "sudo rsync" should be able to use your SSH agent.
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_AUTH_SOCK"

# Ditto for GPG agent
#Defaults:%sudo env_keep += "GPG_AGENT_INFO"

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on "@include" directives:

@includedir /etc/sudoers.d
